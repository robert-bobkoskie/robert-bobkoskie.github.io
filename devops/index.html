    <h2 id="TRIALS">TRIALS</h2>
    <div><p>
		I've participated in trials originating from international standards bodies as well as corporate sponsored research into novel applications for improved efficiency and cost savings for VoIP products.
		Listen to an <a href="Trials/docs/SIPI_TestCall.mp4"
		              target="_blank">RTP Stream</a>
		captured from the first successful voice call between Tata Communications and France Telecom Orange via SIP-I (ITU.T 1Q.1912.5).
		<br><br>
		This trial provided a roadmap for a project designed to offload TDM traffic between Tata Communications and France Telecom Orange to an IP network utilizing SIP-I.
		<br><br>
		This project leveraged Tata Communications experience from a GSMA trial regarding SIP-I connectivity between international carriers.
		See <a href="#PRESENTATIONS">RESENTATIONS</a>
		for more information on this trial.

		I enhanced productivity and reliability by developing and implementing Agile Software Development Processes for development, testing and delivery to production. 
		<br><br>
		This cross functional work flow diagram presents a methodology; derived from fundamental concepts of the Software Development Lifecycle that promote accountability and incorporate Agile processes for HW/SW Development/Deployment:
		Software Development Processes.pdf
		I developed a solution and guidelines for transitioning mission critical CSO physical servers to a Virtual Environment by
		providing an architecture to support an Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud computing service model:

	<h2 id="PRESENTATIONS">PRESENTATIONS</h2>
    <div><p>
		I presentated original work at the GSMA Trial Team Meeting-21, September 16-17, 2008.
		The presentation was derived from development activities while working at Tata Communications.
		<br><br>
		This trial was sponsored by the GSMA to verify wireless interconnections over IP, which is part of the international GSM Association's program to develop the next generation of wireless services. The trial verified that the GSMA's IP eXchange (IPX) framework can interconnect wireless networks over IP, which is more efficient and flexible than the traditional Time-Division Multiplexing technology. This trial was part of the GSMA's IPX Pre-Commercial Implementation Project, which is verifying the design and operation of IPX networks through a series of trials designed to validate technical and commercial specifications.

		<br><br>
		Here is an RTP stream captured by a probe (running Wireshark) that was located in Tata Communications network. This is one of the first successful calls between mobile operators over an IP eXchange (IPX) framework consisting of:
		TELUS <=SIP-I (ANSI88)=> Tata Communications <=SIP-I (ITU-T92+)=> Telekom Austria. The voice quality of this call was subjectively rated by the two parties on call. The voice quality was also objectively verified through QOS (Jitter, Latency, Packet Loss, R-Factor) measurements.
