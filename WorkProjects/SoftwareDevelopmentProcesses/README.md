Trials 
I've participated in trials originating from international standards bodies as well as corporate sponsored events
Here is an RTP Stream captured from the first successful voice call between Tata Communications and France Telecom Orange via SIPI (ITUT 1Q.1912.5). This is the first step of a project designed to off-load TDM traffic between Tata Communications and France Telecom Orange to an IP network via SIPI.

This project leveraged Tata Communications experience from a GSMA trial regarding SIPI connectivity between international carriers. See Presentations for more information on this trial.
