           Digital media is becoming much more than a supplement in the field of educational technology.
           Online books, journals, collaboration, and even graduate degrees can be obtained exclusively
           through digital resources. Indeed, pedagogy has kept pace with advances in digital technology,
           and for most, the educational experience has been enhanced. However, for those with a visual
           impairment, the ability to travel unabated in a digital world is rife with restrictions that
           limit access to information and educational enrichment. Although assistive technologies such as
           screen readers (text to speech), magnifiers, and high contrast settings allow the visually
           impaired to ride this information superhighway, these tools are often difficult for the visually
           impaired to identify, locate, and administer. Even when configured, there are many differences in
           how assistive technologies are implemented. The current state of assistive technology is not
           progressive enough for alleviating the challenges and inconsistencies the visually impaired face
           when accessing digital media. Introducing standard(s) for assistive technology would remove barriers
           to digital media, and open this autobahn to the visually impaired.

           Another approach to convey visual information is to utilize a second sensory input. A technology
           known as auditory graphing, which is an application of sonification [3] shows promise as an
           assistive technology to enhance learning in geometry, which is a completely visual form of
           mathematics [7]. Sonification uses sound: frequency, amplitude and timbre to convey information.
           Auditory graphs can increase accessibility by allowing observable objects such as curves in a Euclidian
           plane can be visualized. Sonification and standardization of assistive technology are tractable, cost
           effective approaches to enhance pedagogy for the visually impaired.
